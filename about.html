      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a results-driven logistics coordinator with a Masterâ€™s degree in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and a background in Mechanical Engineering. Over the course of my career, I have developed a proven ability to optimize warehouse operations, manage inventory with precision, and lead high-performing teams. My expertise spans B2B/B2C fulfillment, stock accuracy, returns management, and process improvement initiatives. I combine operational know-how with strong analytical capabilities, using tools like Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to support data-driven decision-making and enhance efficiency in dynamic logistics environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career journey reflects a steady progression through diverse roles across logistics, warehousing, and production. As an Inbound Logistics Coordinator at Cygnia Logistics, I refined goods receiving processes, improved inventory accuracy, and resolved supply chain challenges through effective communication with carriers and internal teams. In my part-time roles at Wincanton, I contributed to both returns management and B2B order fulfillment, streamlining workflows to reduce handling time, eliminate backlogs, and improve outbound accuracy. Earlier, at Tuffnells Parcels Express, I supported distribution operations by optimizing storage and ensuring timely dispatch. My career began in manufacturing as a Production Supervisor at Tec-know Dies, where I led a 15-member team, implemented root cause analysis tools, and introduced standardized processes that significantly improved productivity, reduced defects, and minimized downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold an MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from the University of Northampton, accredited by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT). This program equipped me with advanced knowledge in supply chain strategy, operations optimization, and the integration of digital technologies such as Digital Twins and IoT into logistics processes. Before that, I earned a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from the College of Engineering Trivandrum, where I built a strong technical foundation in engineering principles, and a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from the State Board of Technical Education, Kerala, which sparked my passion for operational excellence and process optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring a blend of technical and operational expertise, with proficiency in warehouse management systems (Manhattan SCALE, WMS), data analysis tools (Excel, Tableau, Power BI, IBM SPSS), and foundational programming in Python. My skill set includes warehouse operations, inventory management, team leadership, root cause analysis, B2B/B2C fulfillment, and compliance with health, safety, and GDPR regulations. I am also experienced in project management, risk assessment, and employee engagement strategies, enabling me to drive both process efficiency and team performance.
