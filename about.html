  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> I am a dedicated and detail-oriented MSc graduate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from the University of Northampton, UK. With a strong academic background and hands-on industry experience, I bring a practical understanding of end-to-end supply chain processes, warehouse operations, and production management.

My professional journey began in India, where I completed a Diploma and B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering. I gained valuable experience as a Production Supervisor for one year, where I honed my skills in team leadership, process control, and production planning.

Upon moving to the UK, I further advanced my knowledge by pursuing a Master's degree while simultaneously gaining practical exposure through part-time work as a Warehouse Operator. During this time, I developed expertise in B2B and B2C operations, returns processing, and packing procedures, working with industry-standard systems such as Manhattan SCALE WMS.

Currently, I serve as an Inbound Logistics Coordinator at Cygnia Logistics. In this role, I am responsible for coordinating inbound shipments, managing inventory, and ensuring seamless communication between suppliers and internal teams. My role also involves continuous process optimization to enhance operational efficiency and accuracy.

I am passionate about leveraging technology and data-driven strategies to streamline supply chain operations and contribute to overall business performance. With a strong foundation in both technical and operational aspects of logistics, I aim to drive value through innovation, efficiency, and collaboration.</p>
